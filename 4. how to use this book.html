			<h2>How to use this book</h2>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">You better believe it, in fourteen days you’ll
			have your very own composition, even if you’ve
			never played the piano before. You will start
			by learning the fundamentals of music and
			begin improvising and unlocking your innate
			creativity. Lessons are sequential, so be sure to
			work through each one in order, taking notes
			on your worksheet as directed.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Your <a href="26. your worksheet.html" target=”_blank”><span class="bold">Worksheet</span></a> is where you’ll gradually build
			your composition, before translating it to a
			professional lead sheet.
			</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Your <a href="27. your lead sheet.html" target="_blank"><span class="bold">Lead Sheet</span></a> is a clear articulation of
			your music which can be read and played by
			other musicians.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">As your piece becomes established you
			will encounter more ways to develop your
			composition, like techniques to help you refine
			your melody, and more interesting patterns for
			your left hand.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">Whenever you see the instruction <span class="bold">Time to
			choose</span> you’ll need to pick the ‘ingredients’ for
			the music you’re about to make. There are only
			three kinds of ingredients: notes, chords and
			rhythms - that’s it. <span class="bold">Time to choose</span> lays bare
			these underlying elements and structures of
			music, peeling back the composer’s curtain if
			you will.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text"><span class="bold">Time to choose</span> is also designed to push you, to
			coax you out of your comfort zone little by little
			so that progress is inevitable. You might choose
			something you’re not yet familiar with for
			example, or something you haven’t practised for
			months. Although we typically resist challenge
			and change, dipping your toe into unchartered
			waters is the best way to learn.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">⧗ Throughout this book you’ll find exercises
			that I’ll ask you to try for just one minute. It
			might not seem like a lot, but in my experience
			bitesize practice is the way to go. Even when a
			task seems daunting, you can always manage
			a minute, and more often than not things are
			never as hard as we think they are going to be.
			I like to tell my students, the point of exercises
			is not to succeed every time. Success is simply
			doing the exercise, getting from beginning to
			end. I also encourage repetition, multiple passes
			at each exercise until you feel like you’ve had
			a breakthrough. Some aspect of the exercise
			begins to feel like second nature. Repetition isn’t
			sexy but it sure as hell works.</p>

			<p class="font-size-body-text">You can find videos demonstrating the
			exercises in this book on my YouTube channel:</p>
